# HuntTheWumpus
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is a recreation of the classic RPG game Hunt The Wumpus using Java.

<h2>Story</h2>
You are a hunter exploring a cave for the Wumpus, a monster with a very keen sense of hearing. The cave is split into rooms connected to 
each other by paths. You have knowledge of only the rooms which you have visited. Once you are within two rooms of the monster, the color 
of the room becomes red. Your goal is to guess where the monster is and shoot it. If you guess wrong and miss, or if you walk into the 
same room as the monster, he hears you and instantly devours you. If you guess correctly and shoot it, you win!
